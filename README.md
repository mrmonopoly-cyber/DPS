## Overview

**Debug Peripheral System (DPS)** is a lightweight, portable, and modular C-based system for monitoring and interacting with primitive variables over a CAN network.

DPS follows a master-slave model and is designed for use in embedded environments, with stack-allocated object-oriented interfaces and no dynamic memory usage.

Its goal is to simplify debugging and monitoring of systems across distributed nodes without requiring a debugger connection to each one.

## Features

- 🏦 **Stack-allocated object interface** (no dynamic memory)
- ⚡ **CAN-based communication** between master and slaves
- 🔧 **Variable monitoring** with optional post-update callbacks
- 📋 **Strict encapsulation** and portability across platforms
- 🧻 **Debug-friendly** with variable name lookup and print functions
- 📚 **Doxygen-based documentation**

```

The build is intended for both PC simulation and embedded targets. You may need to adjust the `Makefile` or source files for specific targets.

## Documentation

Full API documentation is generated using Doxygen.

To generate the documentation locally:

```sh
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The output will be in the `docs/` directory.

## Contributing
